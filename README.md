# cpp-digimon-minigame

This is a simple project to test c++.

## How does this work?

When you compile and execute this program, it will ask for your name and ask you to select a randomly generated digimon. Then your digimon will fight against randomly generated digimons until your digimon's health reach 0. Finally, it will display how many rounds have you survived.
